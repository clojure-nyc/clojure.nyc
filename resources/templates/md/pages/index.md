## What We're About

The mission of Clojure/NYC is to foster a welcoming, collaborative environment for
idea exchange and learning about Clojure, ClojureScript and their ecosystems. We are a
growing, friendly and vibrant group. We welcome participation from everyone - all you
need is an eagerness to learn and share Clojure!

Find us here, on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-NYC/), and on the [#nyc](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/nyc/)
channel on the [Clojurians](http://clojurians.net/) Slack org.

You can find videos of Clojure/nyc talks on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZTSEKmvMPoBd8bXFkdh8w).
