## What We're About

The mission of Clojure/nyc is to foster a fun, collaborative environment for
idea exchange and learning about Clojure, ClojureScript and their ecosystems. We are a
growing, friendly and vibrant group. We welcome participation from everyone - all you
need is an eagerness to learn, share and try Clojure!

Find us here, on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-NYC/), and on the [#nyc](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/nyc/)
channel on the [Clojurians](http://clojurians.net/) Slack org.

## Our Events

In January we'll have two exciting new libraries presented by members!

### Matrix by Ken Tilton

Notorious Common Lisp and now CLJ/CLJS front-end developer Kenny Tilton will
debut Matrix CLJS, his newest reactive web framework. Matrix is an
“Un-framework”, bucking the ReactJS trend by leveraging a fine-grained dataflow
library to produce a declarative and fast web app library from nothing but
HTML/CSS and ClojureScript. Matrix breaks all the rules, joining concerns
instead of separating them and making all model and view state globally
accessible. Time permitting, questions will be taken before Kenny’s tar and
feathering.

### Shrubbery by Brian Guthrie

If you've ever unit-tested a stateful Clojure application, you may have found
yourself needing to address side effects. For example, a function may query a
database or invoke an external web service. One common way to manage these side
effects is by declaring and implementing protocols that encapsulate the
external call. This has the benefit of making them explicit and easily
testable. Component is an example of a popular library that encourages this
pattern.

Although Clojure protocols are a great way to encapsulate operations with side
effects, they suffer from a general lack of test tooling. In this talk, I'll be
presenting Shrubbery, a library that provides a small set of basic building
blocks for creating protocol implementations specifically designed for testing.
Shrubbery is test framework-agnostic, has no external dependencies, makes no
attempt to perform runtime var replacement and uses no macros. However, there
are some wrinkles in its implementation that may be of interest.
