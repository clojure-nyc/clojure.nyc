If you're interested in promoting your brand and interacting with the Clojure
community in New York, `clojure/nyc` is great way to reach more than 1,500 (and growing!)
Clojurists.

Here are some of the things that all `clojure/nyc` sponsors get:

- Branding: We'll put your logo on the official `clojure/nyc` and
  `ClojureBridge NYC` t-shirts, and on the clojure.nyc website.
- Shout-outs: We'll mention your organization at the start of each event. We'll
  also tweet about you -- just tell us what you'd like folks to know.
- Highlighted Job Openings: We'll list and highlight any job openings you've
  got available on our newsletter, which goes out to our mailing list full of
  awesome Clojure engineers.
- Swag distribution: If you'd like to give out merch, we'll hand it out to attendees at our
  events.
- Placement: We'll include information about your organization as part
  ClojureBridge NYC materials.

## Sponsorship Levels

We offer three sponsorship levels:

- $1,000
- $2,500
- $5,000

All sponsors receive the all benefits, but our larger sponsors get more prominent
placement and recognition.
