If you're interested in promoting your brand and interacting with the
Clojure community in New York, Clojure/NYC is great way to reach more
than 1,700 (and growing!) Clojurists.

Here are some of the things that all Clojure/NYC sponsors get:

- Branding: We'll put your logo on the official Clojure/NYC T-Shirts,
  and on the clojure.nyc website.
- Shout-outs: We'll mention your organization at the start of each
  event. We'll also tweet about you -- just tell us what you'd like
  folks to know.
- Highlighted Job Openings: We'll list and highlight any job openings
  you've got available on our newsletter, which goes out to our
  mailing list full of awesome Clojure engineers.
- Swag distribution: If you'd like to give out merch, we'll hand it
  out to attendees at our events.
- Placement: We'll include information about your organization as part
  events materials.

## FAQs

### I'm interested! How do I become a sponsor?

We encourage our sponsors to reach out to the Clojure/NYC organizing
team directly. You can do so by emailing
[org@clojure.nyc](mailto:org@clojure.nyc).

### What do the sponsored funds cover?

We're committed to making all of our events accessible to everyone and
free of charge, so your support helps cover the cost of food, drink
and supplies. In addition, a large portion of the sponsorship funds go
directly to hosting annual ClojureBridge NYC events, a series of
beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented
groups in tech.
