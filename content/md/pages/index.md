## What We're About

The mission of Clojure/NYC is to foster a welcoming, collaborative
environment for idea exchange and learning about Clojure,
ClojureScript and their ecosystems. We are a growing, friendly and
vibrant group. We welcome participation from everyone - all you need
is an eagerness to learn and share Clojure!
